Making program portable:
    - use pyinstaller to create an exe from python files, this way we can use pip packages without having to worry about making virtual environment on machines

    Installation:
        - pip install pyinstaller

    Usage:
        - pyinstaller --onefile your_script.py
            - this analyzes imports of 'your_script.py' and creates one exe file
